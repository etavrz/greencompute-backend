ESD occurs when an electrical charge builds up on a surface and is discharged, potentially damaging sensitive electronic equipment. \\n\\nAccording to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), maintaining an RH level of 40-55% can help reduce the risk of ESD. This is because higher RH levels increase the conductivity of the air, allowing charges to dissipate more quickly and reducing the likelihood of a discharge.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that maintaining the correct RH level is just one aspect of preventing ESD in data centers. Other measures, such as using anti-static mats and wrist straps, can also help reduce the risk of ESD.\\n\\nFor more information on this topic, I would recommend consulting industry standards and guidelines, such as those published by ASHRAE or the Uptime Institute.\", expected_output='Elevated relative humidity (RH) levels, such as 40% RH at the IT equipment intake, help mitigate electrostatic discharge (ESD) threats in data center environments.
