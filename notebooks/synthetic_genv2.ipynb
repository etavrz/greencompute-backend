Chief among these is establishing what range of cooling air temperature and humidity is appropriate for the IT equipment. All other design considerations stem from this.\\n\\nEfficient air-based cooling systems for data centers are characterized by:\\n\\nA relatively high cooling air temperature.\\nCooling supply air completely separated from cooling return air.\\nA short, low pressure drop air circulation path.\\nMoving only as much air as needed.\\nTaking advantage of economizing opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\nSub-Measures for EEM 6.1-1: Plan and Design for Energy-Efficient Air-Based Cooling\\tPage\\nEEM 6.1-1.1: Bring the Source of Cooling Closer to the IT Equipment\\t39\\nEEM 6.1-1.2: Implement Airside Economizing\\t40\\nEEM 6.1-1.3: Implement a 100% Outside Air System\\t40\\nEEM 6.1-1.4: Provide Computer Room with its Own Cooling System\\t41\\n\\n\\n\\n## EEM 6.1-1.1: Bring the Source of Cooling Closer to the IT Equipment\\n\\nFor this EEM, \"the source of cooling\" refers to the cold refrigerant or chilled water supplied by the cooling system. In most data center cooling systems this source cools air via a cooling coil, and the air in turn cools the IT equipment. Cooling with air is less energy efficient than cooling with liquid, SO decreasing the distance between the cooling coil and the IT equipment provides efficiency gains.\\n\\nThere are a variety of products that accomplish this. They can be deployed as supplemental cooling for hot zones in the data center, or they can be installed throughout. Two examples:\\n\\n## Rear Door Heat Exchanger (RDHx)\\n\\nThis is a chilled water cooling coil designed to mount on the rear (exhaust side) of an IT equipment rack. The IT equipment internal fans propel the warm air through the coil. When used as supplemental cooling, the aim of the RDHx is to reduce the temperature of the exhaust air of the high-density rack to align with the exhaust temperature of the less-dense racks.\\n\\n## In-Row Cooling Unit\\n\\nThis is a CRAC or CRA'], retrieval_context=None, additional_metadata={'evolutions': ['In-Breadth'], 'synthetic_input_quality': 1.0, 'context_quality': 0.9}, comments=None, tools_called=None, expected_tools=None, source_file='output.txt'),\n",

Maintain balanced loads between phases to reduce waste heat and optimize transformer operation.\\n2. Keep the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) at the main feeder panel at 5% or less, which is linked to maintaining a high power factor (PF).\\n3. Ensure the power factor at the main feeder panel is 0.90 or higher to avoid high utility tariffs and improve efficiency.\\n4. Retrofit IT equipment to sustain a high power factor and low THD, enhancing the overall performance of the power distribution system.', context=[' Critical Components\\n\\nEfficient performance of the electric distribution system cannot be consistently maintained without having a means of monitoring what it is doing. Make sure you have the ability to see input power, output power, power factor, and total harmonic distortion at each major power conversion step in the chain.\\n\\n## EEM 2-3: Maintain High Power Quality\\n\\nHigh power quality means less loss in the power distribution system.

Redistribute the loads to improve the balance. If the transformer is in an air-conditioned space, the reduced waste heat will also reduce the load on the cooling system.\\n\\nGenerally, the distribution to the UPS is automatically balanced because all flow is three-phase up to that point. At the UPS output and below, voltage balance is achieved by equally distributing the IT loads among the phases (typically phases A-B, B-C, and C-A).\\n\\n## EEM 2-3.2: Maintain Total Harmonic Distortion at Main Feeder Panel at 5% or Less\\n\\nThis measure is simply stating EEM 2-3.3: Maintain Power Factor at Main Feeder Panel at 0.90 or Higher in another way, as THD and Power Factor (PF) are mathematically related. If the facility is subject to PF tariffs from the electric utility provider, maintaining a low THD / high PF ensures the facility operates efficiently and avoids high tariffs.\\n\\nGenerally, if the IT power supplies have a high power factor, then power factor and THD will be excellent on the downstream side of the UPS. UPS input power factor correction takes care of the THD and/or power factor on the 480-volt side. In the chiller plant, harmonic filters (typically \"line reactors\") on the VFD inputs of the chillers are generally recommended.\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\nEEM 2-3.3: Maintain Power Factor at Main Feeder Panel at 0.90 or Higher\\n\\nIf the facility is subject to Power Factor (PF) tariffs from the electric utility, maintaining a high power factor ensures the facility operates efficiently and avoids high tariffs. See also EEM 2-3.2: Maintain Total Harmonic Distortion at Main Feeder Panel at 5% or Less.\\n\\nEEM 2-3.4: Retrofit IT Equipment to Maintain High Power Factor and Low Total Harmonic Distortion Low power factor (PF) and high total harmonic distortion (THD) cause the power distribution system to operate inefficiently. Correcting the power factor and THD at the UPS input and the IT power supply saves energy.\\n\\n## EEM 2-4: Implement Energy Efficient UPS Systems\\n\\nA standard double-conversion UPS transforms the power passing through it, twice. First, a rectifier converts incoming AC power to DC in order to keep a battery bank charged. The power flows through the battery bank, and then an inverter transforms the DC power back to AC. Each of these steps has some loss associated with it.

Chief among these is establishing what range of cooling air temperature and humidity is appropriate for the IT equipment. All other design considerations stem from this.\\n\\nEfficient air-based cooling systems for data centers are characterized by:\\n\\nA relatively high cooling air temperature.\\nCooling supply air completely separated from cooling return air.\\nA short, low pressure drop air circulation path.\\nMoving only as much air as needed.\\nTaking advantage of economizing opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\nSub-Measures for EEM 6.1-1: Plan and Design for Energy-Efficient Air-Based Cooling\\tPage\\nEEM 6.1-1.1: Bring the Source of Cooling Closer to the IT Equipment\\t39\\nEEM 6.1-1.2: Implement Airside Economizing\\t40\\nEEM 6.1-1.3: Implement a 100% Outside Air System\\t40\\nEEM 6.1-1.4: Provide Computer Room with its Own Cooling System\\t41\\n\\n\\n\\n## EEM 6.1-1.1: Bring the Source of Cooling Closer to the IT Equipment\\n\\nFor this EEM, \"the source of cooling\" refers to the cold refrigerant or chilled water supplied by the cooling system. In most data center cooling systems this source cools air via a cooling coil, and the air in turn cools the IT equipment. Cooling with air is less energy efficient than cooling with liquid, SO decreasing the distance between the cooling coil and the IT equipment provides efficiency gains.\\n\\nThere are a variety of products that accomplish this. They can be deployed as supplemental cooling for hot zones in the data center, or they can be installed throughout. Two examples:\\n\\n## Rear Door Heat Exchanger (RDHx)\\n\\nThis is a chilled water cooling coil designed to mount on the rear (exhaust side) of an IT equipment rack. The IT equipment internal fans propel the warm air through the coil. When used as supplemental cooling, the aim of the RDHx is to reduce the temperature of the exhaust air of the high-density rack to align with the exhaust temperature of the less-dense racks.\\n\\n## In-Row Cooling Unit\\n\\nThis is a CRAC or CRA'], retrieval_context=None, additional_metadata={'evolutions': ['Reasoning'], 'synthetic_input_quality': 1.0, 'context_quality': 0.9}, comments=None, tools_called=None, expected_tools=None, source_file='output.txt'),\n",
       " Golden(input='Compare the roles of maintaining high PF and low THD in avoiding utility tariffs.', actual_output=None, expected_output='Maintaining a high Power Factor (PF) and low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) are crucial in avoiding utility tariffs and ensuring efficient operation of the power distribution system. A high PF (0.90 or higher) indicates efficient utilization of electrical power, reducing the risk of incurring charges from utility providers that penalize low PF values. Similarly, keeping THD at 5% or less minimizes electrical inefficiencies and potential surcharges associated with poor power quality. Both measures are mathematically related and help in reducing energy losses, ensuring compliance with utility requirements, and avoiding additional costs.', context=[' Critical Components\\n\\nEfficient performance of the electric distribution system cannot be consistently maintained without having a means of monitoring what it is doing. Make sure you have the ability to see input power, output power, power factor, and total harmonic distortion at each major power conversion step in the chain.\\n\\n## EEM 2-3: Maintain High Power Quality\\n\\nHigh power quality means less loss in the power distribution system. High quality is achieved by balancing voltage and loads between phases, and maintaining a high PF / low THD.\\n\\n\\n\\nSub-Measures for EEM 2-3: Maintain High Power Quality\\tPage\\nEEM 2-3.1: Maintain Balanced Loads Between Phases\\t10\\nEEM 2-3.2: Maintain Total Harmonic Distortion at Main Feeder Panel at 5% or Less\\t10\\nEEM 2-3.3: Maintain Power Factor at Main Feeder Panel at 0.90 or Higher\\t11\\nEEM 2-3.4: Retrofit IT Equipment to Maintain High Power Factor and Low Total Harmonic\\t11\\nDistortion\\n\\n\\n\\n## EEM 2-3.1: Maintain Balanced Loads Between Phases\\n\\nUnbalanced electric loads in 3-phase systems cause higher current flows between the legs of the transformer, resulting in waste heat and less efficient transformer operation. Redistribute the loads to improve the balance. If the transformer is in an air-conditioned space, the reduced waste heat will also reduce the load on the cooling system.\\n\\nGenerally, the distribution to the UPS is automatically balanced because all flow is three-phase up to that point. At the UPS output and below, voltage balance is achieved by equally distributing the IT loads among the phases (typically phases A-B, B-C, and C-A).\\n\\n## EEM 2-3.2: Maintain Total Harmonic Distortion at Main Feeder Panel at 5% or Less\\n\\nThis measure is simply stating EEM 2-3.3: Maintain Power Factor at Main Feeder Panel at 0.90 or Higher in another way, as THD and Power Factor (PF) are mathematically related. If the facility is subject to PF tariffs from the electric utility provider, maintaining a low THD / high PF ensures the facility operates efficiently and avoids high tariffs.\\n\\nGenerally, if the IT power supplies have a high power factor, then power factor and THD will be excellent on the downstream side of the UPS. UPS input power factor correction takes care of the THD and/or power factor on the 480-volt side. In the chiller plant, harmonic filters (typically \"line reactors\") on the VFD inputs of the chillers are generally recommended.\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\nEEM 2-3.3: Maintain Power Factor at Main Feeder Panel at 0.90 or Higher\\n\\nIf the facility is subject to Power Factor (PF) tariffs from the electric utility, maintaining a high power factor ensures the facility operates efficiently and avoids high tariffs. See also EEM 2-3.2: Maintain Total Harmonic Distortion at Main Feeder Panel at 5% or Less.\\n\\nEEM 2-3.4: Retrofit IT Equipment to Maintain High Power Factor and Low Total Harmonic Distortion Low power factor (PF) and high total harmonic distortion (THD) cause the power distribution system to operate inefficiently. Correcting the power factor and THD at the UPS input and the IT power supply saves energy.\\n\\n## EEM 2-4: Implement Energy Efficient UPS Systems\\n\\nA standard double-conversion UPS transforms the power passing through it, twice. First, a rectifier converts incoming AC power to DC in order to keep a battery bank charged. The power flows through the battery bank, and then an inverter transforms the DC power back to AC. Each of these steps has some loss associated with it. An efficient UPS system will minimize these losses.\\n\\n\\n\\nSub-Measures for EEM 2-4: Implement Energy Efficient UPS Systems\\tPage\\nEEM 2-4.1: Replace the UPS with a More Efficient Unit\\t11\\nEEM 2-4.2: Shut Down UPS Modules when Redundancy Level is High Enough\\t11\\nEEM 2-4.3: Use UPS Without Input Filters\\t12\\nEEM 2-4.4: Eliminate or Bypass UPS Systems\\t12\\nEEM 2-4.5: Implement a Switching UPS\\t12\\nEEM 2-4.6: Change UPS DC Capacitors\\t12\\nEEM 2-4.7: Ensure Non-Critical Loads are Not Connected to the UPS\\t12\\n\\n\\n\\n## EEM 2-4.1: Replace the UPS with a More Efficient Unit\\n\\nUPS technology continues to evolve.
