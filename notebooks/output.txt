Here are some effective ways to reduce your data center's energy usage:

1. **Implement occupancy sensors**: Directly save lighting energy by turning off lights when not in use.
2. **Use manually controlled zone lighting control**: Save energy with a timer or manual switch, but be aware that this may still leave the lights on after occupants leave.
3. **Control lighting with a timeclock**: Create pre-defined schedules for when lights are turned on and off to maximize efficiency.
4. **Install peak shaving devices**: Turn down non-essential lights during periods of low occupancy to save energy.

Additionally, consider implementing other measures such as:

* Energy-efficient cooling systems
* Efficient power supplies
* LED lighting upgrades
* Regular maintenance to ensure equipment is functioning efficiently

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce your data center's energy usage and lower its operating costs.
