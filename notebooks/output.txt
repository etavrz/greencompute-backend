Based on the provided guidelines, here are some ways to reduce your data center energy usage:

1. **Implement Lighting Controls**: Turn off lights when not needed, use occupancy sensors to control lighting, and implement manually controlled zone lighting control.
2. **Use Energy-Efficient Lighting Technologies**: Replace fluorescent lighting with LED lighting, which can save a significant percentage of energy use.
3. **Optimize Cooling Systems**: Implement effective air-based cooling systems that minimize heat transfer and maximize airflow.

Additionally, you may also consider the following:

* **Install Peak Shaving Devices on Lighting Systems**: This can help reduce peak demand periods and energy usage when not in operation.
* **Monitor and Adjust Cooling System Performance**: Regularly monitor your cooling system's performance and adjust as needed to optimize efficiency.
* **Implement Energy Recovery Ventilation (ERV) Systems**: These systems recover heat from the exhaust air, reducing the need for additional cooling.

It's also recommended to consult with a professional or conduct further research to determine the best energy-saving measures tailored to your specific data center needs.
