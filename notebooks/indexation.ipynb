      "The Master List is a living document of best-practice recommendations (measures) to increase energy efficiency in data centers. Designed for data center owners, operators, and qualified assessors, this document provides actionable guidance to both prioritize and implement energy saving measures in data centers. The Master List can be used as a stand-alone reference document for in-house improvements or to inform an energy assessment report being prepared for an external organization. More specifically, individuals can copy and paste relevant measures into an action plan or into the recommendations section of an energy assessment report. \n",

      "\n",
      "If your facility does not already have an Energy Manager, consider assigning one. Efforts to improve energy efficiency often falter when there is no clearly identified \"champion\" to lead and coordinate. \n",
      "\n",
      "## EEM 1-1.2: Create a Project Integration Team \n",
      "\n",
      "A major step towards more energy-efficient operation is to create a team. The team sets targets for data center energy efficiency in accordance with federal, state, and local mandates, and company aspirations. The team should include both Facilities and IT personnel to resolve potential communication gaps between these two groups. The process can include: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Set a goal to improve data center energy efficiency and reduce energy use. \n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Resolve potential communication gaps between IT and Facilities organizations. Gaps usually exist when there are organizational issues, cultural differences, especially between employees and outsourced management. \n",
      "3. Make sure the goals of operational activities and services (e.g., the implementation of energy efficiency measures such as installation and commissioning of new systems) are well defined and discussed with all parties. \n",
      "\n",
      "## EEM 1-1.3: Use Life Cycle Cost to Make Decisions \n",
      "\n",
      "Project decisions are often made on the basis of first cost only (the cost of purchasing and installing components and systems). A more optimal fiscal strategy is to consider the life cycle cost of a proposed measure, and compare it to the \"do nothing\" case. Such strategy considers not only first cost but also operating and maintenance cost over the measure's lifetime, including disposal cost. The total life-cycle cost is also known as the total cost of ownership or TCO. Data centers have high power demand in terms of Watts per square foot, which means the energy cost of operating a data center over time can exceed the first cost. An energy-efficient data center, examined from the standpoint of life cycle cost, can justify the purchase of more efficient equipment if it is more costly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Note that closing an inefficient data center and moving to either a more-efficient one internal to the organization, or moving to a commercial co-location facility or the cloud, can sometimes be the best economic choice. \n",
      "\n",
      "## EEM 1-1.4: Engage Upper Management with a Compelling Life-Cycle Cost Case \n",
      "\n",
      "Some energy efficiency measures have little or no first cost to implement, but many others do. Even if a proposed measure has a rapid payback, management may choose not to fund it based on the cost of implementation. A clearly presented analysis of the return on investment of the proposed measure will help management compare it to alternate investment opportunities. \n",

      "The best data center energy efficiencies are achieved when the efficiency is considered and included in the design of the data center layout and support systems (electric distribution, cooling, lighting) from the beginning.

There are many different efficiency metrics that can be applied to data center support systems - Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), Cooling System Efficiency, Electric Distribution Efficiency, and more. It is important to become familiar with different metrics to determine which ones are most appropriate for a given data center. Then determine what measurement devices and system(s) are needed to collect the data and calculate the metrics. \n",

      "Identify the key parameters of your systems that indicate how well they are performing. Determine which of these parameters are already being monitored and what your recording capabilities are. Add instrumentation to capture the parameters that are currently not monitored. Finally, implement a program to regularly calibrate your sensors to ensure that you always collect accurate readings. \n",

      "EEM 1-2.3: Install Monitoring Equipment to Measure System Efficiency and Performance \n",

      "Many data centers have only a few main electric meters. These may report the total energy use of the facility accurately, but they cannot indicate how the energy use is distributed among the IT equipment and support systems. Installing sub-meters at key locations provides a powerful tool for measuring the energy performance of individual systems. Providing these sub-meters with recording capability allows you to monitor system performance over time, providing evidence of degradations and improvements. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you do not have permanent instruments installed to measure key performance parameters, you can install temporary instruments to obtain the same information for selected periods. Electric power meters, chilled water flow meters, and temperature sensors can be quickly deployed and will quantify system performance. Permanent meters are preferred SO as to enable continuous tracking of performance over the life of the facility. \n",

      "Data centers consume a lot of energy - not only the IT equipment itself but all of the support systems as well. Even small gains in energy efficiency tend to achieve large energy savings. Knowing where energy is being used in the data center, and how efficiently, is key to capturing the savings. If an energy monitoring system is not in place yet, consider installing one. \n",
      "\n",
      "A more comprehensive option is to install a Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) system. In addition to helping monitor, manage, and control energy efficiency, a DCIM system can support inventory, design, procurement, and managing IT/infrastructure capacity and redundancy. \n",

      "A data center monitoring system can include a real-time dashboard. This is analogous to a car's dashboard - it provides an overview of real time data of key variables in an easy-to-interpret format.

This is especially true of power supplies in double-fed equipment, which under normal operation will never get to 50% rated load, and often much less.

Stability means that the system can be balanced successfully and that external disturbances have limited impact on that balance. In addition, the diffusers should have characteristics promoting penetration of the supply air into the cold aisles. Diffusers for human-occupied spaces are designed to have the supply air hug the ceiling, to avoid the discomfort of downdrafts. This type of diffuser is usually not appropriate in the data center context. \n",

      "Many downflow CRAC/CRAHs have supply fans that blow air directly downwards. A shallow floor plenum will interfere with this flow, cause the fan to operate inefficiently, and may work against a uniform pressure distribution in the plenum. Turning vanes mounted directly under the CRAC/CRAH can alleviate this situation, but still contribute to poor air flow efficiency. A taller floor plenum is preferred, if possible. Another option is to specify CRAC/CRAHs with vertical-axis plug fans, which blow air horizontally. See EEM 6.1- 2.3.1: Install Efficient Fans in CRAC/ACU/CRAH/AHUs. \n",

      "\n",
      "For this EEM, \"the source of cooling\" refers to the cold refrigerant or chilled water supplied by the cooling system. In most data center cooling systems this source cools air via a cooling coil, and the air in turn cools the IT equipment. Cooling with air is less energy efficient than cooling with liquid, SO decreasing the distance between the cooling coil and the IT equipment provides efficiency gains. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a variety of products that accomplish this. They can be deployed as supplemental cooling for hot zones in the data center, or they can be installed throughout. Two examples: \n",
      "\n",
      "## Rear Door Heat Exchanger (RDHx) \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a chilled water cooling coil designed to mount on the rear (exhaust side) of an IT equipment rack. The IT equipment internal fans propel the warm air through the coil. When used as supplemental cooling, the aim of the RDHx is to reduce the temperature of the exhaust air of the high-density rack to align with the exhaust temperature of the less-dense racks. \n",
      "\n",
      "## In-Row Cooling Unit \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a CRAC or CRAH with a form factor that matches the IT equipment racks. It is placed in the row and serves the racks immediately adjacent. \n",
      "\n",
      "These technologies are still considered \"air-based\" cooling, as the final step of extracting heat from the IT equipment relies entirely on air. For solutions that bring liquid into contact with the IT equipment itself, see Category 6.2: Liquid-Based Cooling. \n",

      "## EEM 6.1-1.2: Implement Airside Economizing \n",
      "\n",
      "Airside economizing refers to the scheme of drawing outdoor air directly into the data center for cooling purposes. There are two basic methods: \n",
      "\n",
      "## Non-Integrated \n",
      "\n",
      "The economizer does not open until the outdoor air temperature drops to the supply air temperature setpoint. It then opens fully, outdoor air is drawn in to the data center, and it is exhausted from the data center after one pass. At this point the refrigerant compressors in the cooling system can shut off, as the cooling load is carried entirely by the outdoor air. Only the fans need to run. If the outdoor air temperature continues to drop, the economizer begins to close. The outdoor air is mixed with some of the exhaust air to maintain the supply air at the desired setpoint temperature. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Integrated \n",
      "\n",
      "This is similar to the non-integrated scheme, but instead the economizer opens fully when the outdoor air temperature drops below the return air temperature. The refrigerant compressors still need to run, but their load is reduced. If the outdoor air temperature continues to drop until it reaches the supply air temperature setpoint, then the economizer behaves as in the non-integrated case. The integrated scheme saves more energy, as the economizer is able to operate for more hours of the year. \n",
      "\n",
      "The effectiveness of airside economizing depends on the local climate and the Allowable and Recommended temperature ranges in the data center. Even with relatively narrow ranges, airside economizing can often provide large annual savings. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the data center space is humidity controlled, the humidity of the outdoor air must also be considered when assessing the viability of airside economizing. For more on this subject, see \"Humidity Control in Data Centers\", at https://datacenters.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/Humidity%20Control%20in%20Data%20Centers.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Off-the-shelf ACUs and AHUs can often be ordered with an economizer option direct from the manufacturer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Airside economizing in combination with CRAC/CRAHs is possible, but the economizer must be designed and installed as a separate piece of equipment. \n",
      "\n",
      "If adding an economizer to an existing facility, note that you will need the ability to move a relatively large volume of air simultaneously into and out of the building. Design for low-pressure drop intake and exhaust paths to minimize fan energy. \n",
      "\n",
      "## EEM 6.1-1.3: Implement a 100% Outside Air System \n",
      "\n",
      "Integrated airside economizing uses outside air to cool the data center only when the outside air temperature is less than the return air temperature from the data center. Otherwise, it is more efficient to recirculate the data center air and cool the return air stream. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the supply and return air temperatures are raised, in some climates it becomes more efficient to simply use 100% outside air all the time for cooling. The number of hours in the year when the outside air temperature exceeds the Recommended maximum supply air temperature diminishes as the latter is increased. Likewise, the number of hours that the Allowable maximum temperature is exceeded diminishes. This makes occasional excursions above the Recommended maximum, but less than or equal to the Allowable maximum, less frequent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another strategy for successfully implementing continuous 100% outside air is to use direct evaporative cooling during the hours of highest outside air temperature. This is a much more efficient method of cooling \n",

      "CRAC/ACUs use a refrigerant loop to extract heat from the supply air stream and send it to the refrigerant condenser. In turn, the heat is rejected from the condenser to the environment. \n",
      "\n",
      "One common method of heat rejection employs water-cooled condensers connected to an outdoor \"dry cooler\" via a water loop. This can be a convenient physical arrangement, but is generally the least efficient. It incurs the energy cost of the water loop pumps, there are two heat exchange steps, and the final stage of heat rejection is an (inefficient) air-cooled coil. \n",
      "Another common method runs refrigerant lines from the compressor to an outdoor air-cooled refrigerant condensing coil. This is a more energy efficient scenario, but it typically involves running refrigerant lines from each indoor cooling its paired outdoor condenser. \n",

During the lowest wet bulb periods, the towers may be able to cool the chilled water return to the chilled water supply temperature setpoint, allowing the chillers to be shut off entirely. The air handlers see the same chilled water supply temperature at all times, allowing them to maintain the required temperature and humidity requirements. Waterside economizing also offers an additional level of redundancy by providing a non-compressor cooling solution for portions of the year; even in hot periods, a water-side economizer can often provide IT inlet temperatures in the ASHRAE Allowable range, even when it can't provide temperatures in the Recommended range, allowing continued IT operation when there is a chiller failure. \n",

This arrangement provides a constant condenser water flow rate through each chiller's condenser. Condenser water pumps are typically selected to be slightly over sized, and the desired flow rates are achieved by restricting the flow of each pump with a balancing valve. This wastes energy, as the pumps continuously work against the obstruction of the balancing valves. A more efficient method of controlling the condenser water flow rate is to install a VFD on the condenser water pump motor, completely open or remove the balancing valve, and manually adjust the VFD speed to provide the desired flow rate. \n",

      "Will reducing the CW flow help optimize the efficiency of the entire chilled water plant? The plant is a series of linked loops. Reducing the energy requirement of one loop may merely shift the energy demand to another loop, for zero or even negative net savings. The proper approach is to optimize all the loops together in order to achieve the best plant efficiency. Reducing CW flow will save CW pump energy, but it tends to increase chiller lift, which in turn decreases chiller efficiency. The chiller is typically the greatest energy-using component in the plant. If the CW flow rate and/or CW dP are too high, the CW pump energy will be disproportionately large. Decreasing the CW flow rate will provide CW pump savings that may or may not outweigh the increased chiller energy use.

      "Evaporatively cooled chillers are similar to water-cooled chillers, but rather than using a refrigerant-to-water heat exchanger to reject heat to a condensing water loop, their hot gaseous refrigerant is condensed by evaporating water flowing over the condenser tubes.. This reduces the number of heat exchange steps from two to one, and ties the condensing temperature to the ambient wet-bulb temperature. The condenser, water, sump and pump, etc., are usually all integral to the chiller, though remote evaporative condensers are also used. \n",

If the setpoint can be raised without adversely affecting cooling performance in the data center space, doing SO will yield immediate gains.

As a rule of thumb, chiller efficiency improves by 1% for every 2 deg F the evaporator leaving water temperature is raised, all other factors held equal. This holds only to a point; if the chiller lift is reduced too much, it will no longer operate. The room for adjustment varies among chiller make/models, and depends largely on the chiller loading. \n",
      "2. It can affect the efficiency of the CHW distribution system.. If raising the CHW supply setpoint is not accompanied by a corresponding raising of the supply air temperature setpoint, an elevated CHWST may result in a smaller CHW delta-T, and therefore a greater chilled water flow rate to handle a given load. This means increased pumping energy for a given hydronic system pressure drop. \n",
      "3. A lower CHWST causes greater air dehumidification at the cooling coil via condensation. The dehumidification may be a desired feature of the design, or it may occur unnecessarily, by default. In either case, this latent cooling represents a load on the chiller, and therefore an energy expense. \n",
      "\n",
      "Note: A typical CHWST setpoint for facilities with normal space humidity control requirements is about 45F. This setpoint is typical even in facilities that have relaxed or even no humidity requirements, due to the persistence of design \"rules of thumb\". The upper end of the ASHRAE Recommended humidity range is 59°F dew point, thus any chilled water temperature below this will result in inadvertent dehumidification. \n",

      "For air-cooled chiller plants in colder climates, adding dry coolers to the return chilled water line can be an effective way to achieve efficient cooling. Dry coolers are relatively inexpensive, and do not have the maintenance issues associated with open (wet) cooling towers. If the plant is already water-cooled, adding dry coolers does not have much benefit. Cooling tower maintenance is already incurred, and waterside economizing offers a substantial energy efficiency opportunity. See EEM 7.2-1.4.1: Add Integrated Waterside Economizer to CHW Plant. \n",

      "Dry coolers have a relatively large approach temperature, SO they achieve the greatest cooling benefit in cold climates.

      "\n",
      "1. The chillers can be turned off during peak electric demand periods, saving significantly on electric cost. This requires that the chiller plant has a maximum cooling capacity that significantly exceeds the average cooling load, SO that the cooling plant can simultaneously keep the data center cool and store enough \"coolth\" during non-peak hours to allow coasting through the peak hours. \n",
      "2. During chiller runtime the cooling load can be adjusted (by controlling the rate of TES recharge) to have the chiller plant operate at peak efficiency. \n",
      "3. The chillers will spend a greater percentage of their runtime during night hours, when ambient temperatures are cooler and the cooling plant can reject heat more efficiently. \n",
      "4. A thermal storage system offers another level of redundancy to the cooling plant. \n",
      "\n",
      "For a given storage capacity, tanks containing phase-change materials (ice, eutectic salt, paraffin) are smaller than a chilled water tank. However, the chillers generally must be able to produce colder temperatures (below the freezing point of water in the case of ice storage). The existing chillers may not be capable of this, in which case new chillers would be required. Chillers that produce sub-freezing temperatures are generally less efficient than the standard chilled water variety. It is common for phase-change storage systems to use more annual energy than an equivalent, non-storage chilled water plant, but they still have the advantage of allowing peak demand charges to be avoided. A chilled water storage system can offer significant annual energy reduction over an equivalent, non-storage chilled water plant, but usually requires a very large tank. Siting the tank can pose a challenge. Often the tank is placed underground, for example under a parking lot. \n",
      "\n",
      "A bonus of thermal energy storage is that the chilled water pumps can distribute cooling from the thermal storage quickly after the generator starts during a utility power outage, whereas the chillers typically have re- start delays that can adversely affect the data center temperatures. \n",

This nominal condition may not be the same from one manufacturer to the next, SO exercise care when making comparisons. A tower with a smaller approach temperature is more efficient and enjoys the same advantages of an oversized tower. A low approach temperature tower is often created merely by oversizing the tower but can also be created by a different design without increasing the physical dimensions of the unit. A lower approach temperature can improve chiller efficiency. For example, see EEM 7.2-1.4.3: Decrease the Condenser Water Temperature Setpoint. \n",

While this helps avoid the drop in pump efficiency that accompanies turbulent inlet flow, it comes at the cost of increased pressure drop. A more efficient arrangement is to design the piping, wherever possible, to provide a straight section of pipe at the pump inlet that is at least ten pipe diameters in length. This is normally sufficient to straighten out the flow and can often be worked into the design with no pressure drop penalty. \n",

Two pressure ports are provided, one on either end of the valve, to determine the flow rate that results from different throttling positions. Using the pressure drop across the valve to determine flow rate does not work properly unless a significant pressure drop is developed -- but this is precisely what we wish to avoid if we want to minimize pumping energy. \n",

      "Balancing the flow of the system near the pump is not a good choice in terms of energy use. For example, a Bell & Gossett model 3DS-10S triple duty valve that is 80% open at design flow adds about 5.5 feet w.g. of pressure drop. Assuming $0.10/kWh, the pressure drop due to the triple duty valve would account for roughly $2,000 to $3,000 in annual pumping electrical costs (continuous duty). Even at 100% open, it generates a constant parasitic pressure drop of over 4 ft. w.g. \n",

The pressure drop across the chiller barrel is often used by chiller manufacturers for low flow monitoring and, on a new machine, is an effective and low cost method of determining loop flow. A low pressure drop (0 to 0.5 ft. w.g.) flow meter may be added to the loop to ease the balancing and provide ongoing monitoring, allowing for improved preventive maintenance and diagnosis. \n",

Unless the component is undersized or assigned an unobtainable setpoint, the control valve will automatically throttle it as necessary. Modern DDC control valves sized properly for the system can provide both control and this automatic balance function. To allow for future spot fixes, the addition of one more P-T port can provide the ability to spot balance components using the shutoff valves for balance where required. To determine flow, P-T taps can be installed on either side of the 2-way control valve. Then the flow can be determined by reading the pressure across these taps and the consulting the CV table supplied by the valve manufacturer. A less reliable method of determining the design flow point that requires only the two P-T ports typically installed is to compare the pressure drop across the component to the manufacturer's design pressure drop submittal data. The appropriate CHW pressure setpoint to provide the minimum needed flow to all coils at design conditions is also determined during balancing. Once this value is known the pump impeller can be trimmed as required, or the pump speed can be set by VFD. \n",

A pump does not have a single efficiency value, but rather a \"map\" that varies according to pump pressure, flow rate, impeller diameter, and impeller speed.

      "Typical design practice calls for selecting an oversized pump for the given application and then trimming the impeller to match actual conditions, for example specifying a maximum impeller diameter of 85%. This tends to decrease the efficiency of the pump (losses at the larger gap at the cutwater). A more energy-efficient alternative is to retain the full impeller size and use a VFD to limit the maximum pump speed to the value that provides the design flow. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the impeller is untrimmed, the pump must still be selected to operate at its peak efficiency point at turndown; this is done by scaling the design conditions up to the untrimmed impeller point using the pump laws. Most pumps are already available in differing motor speeds and comparisons of curves for a single pump at 1750 rpm and 1180 rpm will quickly show that lower speeds do not adversely impact efficiency. This selection approach ensures that there are no losses from off-curve operation and will yield the highest possible efficiency. Losses in the VFD are minimal compared to the efficiency improvement that can be realized in the pump as long as the VFD and motor are sized for the actual operating power (not the full speed operating power requirement). The pump motor is selected to provide the necessary power to produce the design flow. \n",

A constant flow of chilled water is delivered to each coil location. Each coil is equipped with a bypass leg, and each 3-way valve modulates to divert as much water through the coil as is currently needed for cooling purposes. The remaining water bypasses the coil. This method is energy intensive. With the advent of inexpensive, reliable variable speed drives for pump motors, the preferred design eliminates the bypasses and replaces the 3-way valves with 2-way valves. The 2-way valves modulate as needed to serve the cooling load, and the pump motor speed varies in response to the demand by maintaining a constant pressure at the far end of the distribution loop. In facilities that experience varying load, it may be cost effective to go one step further and program the control system to vary the pressure setpoint in response to the position of the most-open 2-way valve. \n",

The pump has to work against this restriction.  \\nThese valves traditionally serve two purposes: They limit the maximum flow through a component and they provide a flow measurement point. This functionality is typically not necessary in a water distribution system  \\n65  \\nthat uses DDC (Direct Digital Control), even in multiple-building critical facilities. Unless the component is undersized or assigned an unobtainable setpoint, the control valve will automatically throttle it as necessary. Modern DDC control valves sized properly for the system can provide both control and this automatic balance function. To allow for future spot fixes, the addition of one more P-T port can provide the ability to spot balance components using the shutoff valves for balance where required. To determine flow, P-T taps can be installed on either side of the 2-way control valve. Then the flow can be determined by reading the pressure across these taps and the consulting the CV table supplied by the valve manufacturer. A less reliable method of determining the design flow point that requires only the two P-T ports typically installed is to compare the pressure drop across the component to the manufacturer's design pressure drop submittal data. The appropriate CHW pressure setpoint to provide the minimum needed flow to all coils at design conditions is also determined during balancing. Once this value is known the pump impeller can be trimmed as required, or the pump speed can be set by VFD.\"},\n",

For example, a single, physical data storage unit may appear as multiple storage units to the rest of the network. This allows the physical unit to work at greater capacity, reducing the quantity of physical units needed. The total data storage resource can then operate more efficiently.  \\nFor server virtualization in particular, see EEM 3.2-2.2: Implement Server Virtualization.  \\n18'},\n",
