      "1. Inadequate cooling management: Small server rooms may not have the same cooling infrastructure as larger data centers, leading to inefficient cooling and increased energy consumption.\n",

      "4. Inadequate maintenance: Regular maintenance is essential for ensuring that equipment is operating at peak efficiency. However, small server facilities may not have the resources or expertise to perform regular maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Limited space for energy-efficient design: Compact server facilities may have limited space for implementing energy-efficient design features, such as raised floors or hot/cold aisle containment.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Lack of awareness or training: Facility managers and operators may not be aware of the latest energy-efficient design practices or may not have the training to implement them effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Financial constraints: Small server facilities may have limited budgets for investing in energy-efficient equipment or design features.\n",

      "8. Lack of incentives or regulations: There may be a lack of incentives or regulations to encourage energy-efficient design in compact server facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Insufficient data on energy usage: Without accurate data on energy usage, it can be difficult to identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Resistance to change: Facility managers and operators may be resistant to changing established practices or investing in new equipment, even if it is more energy-efficient.\n",
      "  - expected output: The suboptimal energy designs in compact server facilities can be attributed to several underlying factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inadequate Initial Design**: Many small server rooms were not originally designed for server operations, resulting in inefficient room configurations and cooling schemes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Principal-Agent Problem**: Server owners/operators often do not pay utility bills directly, leading to a lack of feedback on energy costs and minimal motivation to pursue energy efficiency improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Business Prioritization**: Operational needs often take precedence over energy efficiency, especially in environments where servers support critical internal functions rather than profit-driven services.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **IT Equipment Issues**: Limited budgets and the absence of regular equipment updates lead to older, less efficient hardware. Additionally, low utilization rates suggest that server consolidation and virtualization could significantly enhance energy efficiency.\n",
