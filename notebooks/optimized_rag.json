A shallow plenum may result in high pressure losses, poor pressure distribution, and high fan energy costs.\n\nCeiling plenum height can be increased if the clear ceiling allows. A ceiling return plenum often means a lower clear ceiling but allows placing the return grilles directly above the hot aisles. Such a plenum needs to be maintained similar to a raised floor.\n\nMany downflow CRAC\/CRAHs have supply fans that blow air directly downwards. A shallow floor plenum will interfere with this flow, cause the fan to operate inefficiently, and may work against a uniform pressure distribution in the plenum. Turning vanes mounted directly under the CRAC\/CRAH can alleviate this situation, but still contribute to poor air flow efficiency. A taller floor plenum is preferred, if possible. Another option is to specify CRAC\/CRAHs with vertical-axis plug fans, which blow air horizontally.

Often cooling water (sometimes refrigerant) is provided to cooling coils placed directly in the rack, and air is circulated by integral fans within that individual server rack (and possibly to one or more adjacent racks).\n\nIn-row cooling refers to a cooling system that is located to serve an individual row of server racks. Often chilled water (or sometimes refrigerant) is provided to cooling coils placed directly in or on the row of servers, and air is circulated by integral fans.\n\nRear Door Heat Exchangers (RDHXs) are a highly efficient option for cooling server racks. RDHXs involve installing a cooling coil directly on the rear (exhaust) section of the server racks.

Air circulation through the cooling coil is provided by the internal server fans themselves; there are no external fans.\n\n## 13.

During economization in a pumped refrigerant system, the compressor is off, and the pump circulates refrigerant to the indoor coil for space cooling.

The number of hours in the year when the outside air temperature exceeds the Recommended maximum supply air temperature diminishes as the latter is increased.

It was a 1200-SF room with roughly 15 racks of servers, located in the basement of an older tower of the medical center. All servers were connected to a UPS which was more than 20 years old. Cooling features included a 10-inch raised floor, perforated tiles, and two air handling units, supported by a chilled water plant with a water-side economizer. Staff experimented with hot\/cold aisle separation, but this proved to be ineffective due to air-gap openings in the room.

Some experimentation may be required to determine which units can be shut off without compromising adequate cooling of the IT equipment.

This can be in the form of an exhaust fan at one location and an opening in another location that allows cool outside air to enter.

          "DCEE_Actions_Master_List_090920_final\n\nAirside economizing refers to the scheme of drawing outdoor air directly into the data center for cooling purposes. There are two basic methods:\n\n## Non-Integrated\n\nThe economizer does not open until the outdoor air temperature drops to the supply air temperature setpoint. It then opens fully, outdoor air is drawn in to the data center, and it is exhausted from the data center after one pass. At this point the refrigerant compressors in the cooling system can shut off, as the cooling load is carried entirely by the outdoor air. Only the fans need to run. If the outdoor air temperature continues to drop, the economizer begins to close. The outdoor air is mixed with some of the exhaust air to maintain the supply air at the desired setpoint temperature.\n\n## Integrated\n\nThis is similar to the non-integrated scheme, but instead the economizer opens fully when the outdoor air temperature drops below the return air temperature. The refrigerant compressors still need to run, but their load is reduced. If the outdoor air temperature continues to drop until it reaches the supply air temperature setpoint, then the economizer behaves as in the non-integrated case. The integrated scheme saves more energy, as the economizer is able to operate for more hours of the year.\n\nThe effectiveness of airside economizing depends on the local climate and the Allowable and Recommended temperature ranges in the data center. Even with relatively narrow ranges, airside economizing can often provide large annual savings.",

For example, a Bell & Gossett model 3DS-10S triple duty valve that is 80% open at design flow adds about 5.5 feet w.g. of pressure drop. Assuming $0.10\/kWh, the pressure drop due to the triple duty valve would account for roughly $2,000 to $3,000 in annual pumping electrical costs (continuous duty). Even at 100% open, it generates a constant parasitic pressure drop of over 4 ft. w.g.\n\nTDVs use a very high pressure drop valve to allow for throttling of the pump to prevent over-pumping. While throttling does reduce pump energy use slightly, it is significantly more efficient to eliminate the throttling valve's pressure drop entirely:\n\n1. Balance the system flow at the far end of the distribution system.\n2. Either trim the pump impeller to match the load when balancing is performed (see EEM 7.4-1.2.6: Trim Pump Impeller and Open Triple Duty Valve), or equip the pump motor with a VFD and control flow by varying the pump speed (see EEM 7.4-2: Implement a Variable Flow Hydronic System). VFDs are often a small premium over a standard motor starter and offer greater flexibility. Throttling valves are redundant on speed controlled (VFD) pumps.\n\nUse of a separate, low pressure drop check valve with a standard butterfly valve lowers the loop pressure drop, as well as improving the serviceability of the system by separating the isolation valve from the check valve entirely.",

An on- premises data center has finite capacity, must be provided with reliable power and communications, and must provide adequate cybersecurity. If an on-premises data center fails, business operations may be impacted unless a back-up data center, sometimes called a fail-over data center, is available, which adds cost and complexity. \n\nCloud and colocation computing\/storage has lower first cost and may have lower operational cost than on-premises data centers. A cloud data center has potentially unlimited capacity. The cloud vendor is responsible for all operations including infrastructure and cybersecurity. It is essentially computing as a service. Colocation facilities, on the other hand, provide rental of space, power, and cooling to customers along with network service to connect customer owned and managed IT systems. Potential advantages of cloud and colocation services are especially significant compared to small on-premises data centers that may lack around-the-clock expert staff, adequate redundancy, and efficient design. \n\nDepending on mission need, organizations may choose to only have an on-premises data center, or take a \"cloud first\" strategy where most or all data needs are provided by the cloud, or a hybrid solution where extremely critical data operations are conducted in an on-premises data center but other operations, such as data storage, are cloud provided.

Implementation of an airside economizer system is simplified with a central air handler system. Optimized air management, such as that provided by hot aisle\/cold aisle configurations, is also easily implemented with a ducted central system. Modular units are notorious for battling each other to maintain data center humidity set points. That is, one unit can be observed to be dehumidifying while an adjacent unit is humidifying. Instead of modular units independently controlled, a centralized control system using shared sensors and set points ensures proper communication among the data center air handlers. Even with modular units, humidity control over make-up air should be all that is required. \n\n## 5.2.2 Low Pressure Drop Air Delivery \n\nA low-pressure drop design (\"oversized\" ductwork or a generous under-floor) is essential to optimizing energy efficiency by reducing fan energy and facilitates long-term buildout flexibility. Ducts should be as short and straight as possible in length, and sized significantly larger than typical office systems, since 24-hour operation of the data center increases the value of energy use over time relative to first cost.
